            I am a first year student Majoring in Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island.
            I have ADHD, which can make day to day life difficult but I usually get by just fine. Some of my hobbies
            include rock climbing and playing videogames. I'm still pretty new to rock climbing, but have been playing 
            videogames for practically my whole life.

            <p id="aboutme_text">One of my favorite things about rock climbing is how involved it is. The only way you 
                can clear a wall is by using
                your entire body and mind, a unique challenge when most sports or activities only require you to use 
                one or the other.

            <p id="aboutme_text">I also really enjoy playing video games, and have done so since I was 6. It is one of my favorite pass times, 
                as there are so many stories to be told and people to interact with. It's one of the most unique story telling mediums of our time, 
            and also one of my goals in taking this class.</p>
